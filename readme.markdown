Intention
=========
The intention of creating this repository is to keep all my throw away lisp programs at one place. I don't think these sources will be useful to anyone

Lisp for web
------------
It is a game voting web application, which is also a kind of tutorial for hunchentoot server.
The original blog can be found on [Adam Petersen's](http://www.adampetersen.se/articles/lispweb.htm) page. The api of hunchentoot has changed since the blog, so there are some minor changes required for it to work
